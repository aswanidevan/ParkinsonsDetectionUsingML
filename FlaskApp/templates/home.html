            Parkinson's disease (PD), or simply Parkinson's, is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central
            nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. The symptoms usually emerge slowly, and as the disease
            worsens, non-motor symptoms become more common. The most obvious early symptoms are tremor, rigidity,
            slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking. Cognitive and behavioral problems may also occur with
            depression, anxiety, and apathy occurring in many people with PD. Parkinson's disease dementia becomes
            common in the advanced stages of the disease. Those with Parkinson's can also have problems with their sleep
            and sensory systems. The motor symptoms of the disease result from the death of cells in the
            substantia nigra, a region of the midbrain, leading to a dopamine deficit. The cause of this cell death
            is poorly understood, but involves the build-up of misfolded proteins into Lewy bodies in the
            neurons. Collectively, the main motor symptoms are also known as parkinsonism or a parkinsonian
            syndrome.

            The cause of PD is unknown, with both inherited and environmental factors believed to play a role. Those
            with an affected family member are at an increased risk of getting the disease, with certain genes known to
            be inheritable risk factors. Other risk factors are those who have been exposed to certain pesticides
            and who have prior head injuries. Coffee drinkers, tea drinkers, and tobacco smokers are at a reduced
            risk.

            Diagnosis of typical cases is mainly based on symptoms, with motor symptoms being the chief complaint. Tests
            such as neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging or imaging to look at dopamine neuronal dysfunction known
            as DaT scan) can be used to help rule out other diseases. Parkinson's disease typically occurs in
            people over the age of 60, of whom about one percent are affected. Males are more often affected than
            females at a ratio of around 3:2. When it is seen in people before the age of 50, it is called
            early-onset PD. By 2015, PD affected 6.2 million people and resulted in about 117,400 deaths
            globally. The average life expectancy following diagnosis is between 7 and 15 years.

            No cure for PD is known; treatment aims to reduce the effects of the symptoms. Initial treatment is
            typically with the medications levodopa (L-DOPA), MAO-B inhibitors, or dopamine agonists. As the disease
            progresses, these medications become less effective, while at the same time producing a side effect marked
            by involuntary muscle movements. At that time, medications may be used in combination and doses may be
            increased. Diet and certain forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving
            symptoms. Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor
            symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the nonmovement-related
            symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems, is less strong.
